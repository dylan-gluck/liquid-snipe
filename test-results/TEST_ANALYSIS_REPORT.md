## ❌ **FAILING TEST SUITE (1/22)**

### **Race Condition Regression Tests** - 0/4 Failing

**Location:** `tests/race-condition-regression.test.ts`

**Critical Issues Identified:**

#### **1. State Machine Transition Logic Errors**
- **Problem:** Invalid state transitions from `PAUSED` and `EXIT_PENDING` states
- **Symptoms:** Repeated warnings about invalid transitions:
  - `No valid transition from PAUSED with trigger PAUSE_REQUESTED`
  - `No valid transition from EXIT_PENDING with trigger PAUSE_REQUESTED`
  - `No valid transition from EXIT_PENDING with trigger MANUAL_EXIT_REQUESTED`
- **Impact:** Race condition protection not working correctly

#### **2. Concurrent Operation Testing Failures**
- **Problem:** Tests simulating concurrent operations on same position failing
- **Error Pattern:** Multiple rapid `PAUSE_REQUESTED` triggers in `PAUSED` state
- **Root Cause:** State machine doesn't handle rapid successive triggers properly

#### **3. Edge Case Handling Issues**
- **Problem:** Position error handling during concurrent operations fails
- **Log:** `Position regression-test-2 encountered error: undefined`
- **Impact:** Error states not properly managed during race conditions
