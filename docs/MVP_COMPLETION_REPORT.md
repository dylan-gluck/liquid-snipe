## 🔄 Before vs After Comparison

### **BEFORE (Mock Implementation)**
```typescript
// Empty placeholder transactions
const transaction = new Transaction();

// Random mock data  
return {
  totalLiquidityUsd: Math.random() * 50000 + 1000,
  tokenAReserve: Math.random() * 1000000,
};

// Placeholder pool parsing
return {
  poolAddress: accounts[0].pubkey.toString(), // Oversimplified
};
```

### **AFTER (Production Implementation)**
```typescript
// Real Jupiter DEX integration
const swapResponse = await this.jupiterApi.swapInstructions({
  quoteResponse: quote,
  userPublicKey: walletPublicKey.toString(),
});

// Real market data from APIs
const poolData = await this.priceFeedService.getPoolLiquidity(poolAddress);
return {
  totalLiquidityUsd: poolData.totalLiquidityUsd,
  volume24h: poolData.volume24h,
  priceRatio: poolData.priceRatio,
};

// DEX-specific transaction parsing
const poolData = await this.parseRaydiumPoolCreation(instruction);
const poolData = await this.parseOrcaPoolCreation(instruction);
```
